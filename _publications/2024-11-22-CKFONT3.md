title: "Positional Component-Guided Hangul Font Image Generation via Deep Semantic Segmentation and Adversarial Style Transfer"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2024-11-22-CKFONT3
excerpt: 'We propose a YOLOv8-driven, positional-aware decomposition of Hangul into initial, medial, and final components, then employ a GAN to recombine them, yielding fonts that better preserve structure and style than existing methods such as MXFont and CKFont. This framework boosts accuracy (lower L1/FID, higher SSIM) and opens the door to finely controllable, multilingual typography. '
