title: "Text-Conditioned Diffusion Model for High-Fidelity Korean Font Generation"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2025-01-15-DKFont
excerpt: 'DK-Font presents a one-shot, text-conditioned diffusion model that turns a single reference glyph into a full, high-fidelity Korean typeface. By fusing a phonetic-aware text encoder with perceptual loss, the method preserves stroke integrity and style consistency across all 2,350 Hangul characters, boosting SSIM from 0.812 to 0.857 and lowering FID to 10.45 compared with Diff-Font.'
