This project explores the use of advanced generative models—specifically diffusion models—for generating high-quality Korean fonts. The goal is to produce structurally consistent and stylistically accurate font images by learning from both printed and handwritten samples.

**Key Highlights:**
- Few-shot learning for unseen character generation.
- Multiscale style injection and CLIP-guided loss integration.
- Structural consistency enforced via Sobel-edge loss.
